# Release Notes v0.20.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Type:** Patch Release (Data Safe and Documentation Fixes)

## Overview

Version 0.20.1 delivers targeted fixes for Data Safe connector handling and documentation tooling. It resolves
plugin execution environment leakage, improves Data Safe status reliability, and enhances environment output to
include critical connector paths.

## ✅ Fixed

- **Environment Variable Leakage in Plugin Execution**
  - Cleared `plugin_status` and `TNS_ADMIN` before plugin execution to prevent cross-plugin contamination
  - Prevents non-experimental plugins from being skipped
  - Ensures each Data Safe connector uses its own configuration

- **Deprecated log_debug() Call**
  - Replaced legacy `log_debug()` usage with `oradba_log DEBUG` in `set_oracle_home_environment`
  - Prevents "command not found" errors when sourcing Data Safe environments

- **Data Safe Instance Name Parsing**
  - Corrected regex handling for `cust_cman` in `cman.ora`
  - Avoids false matches on `WALLET_LOCATION`
  - Improves `cmctl show services` reliability and status output

- **Data Safe Environment Display and TNS_ADMIN**
  - `oradba_env.sh show/status` now prints Data Safe install dir, ORACLE_HOME, TNS_ADMIN, and JAVA_HOME
  - Ensures TNS_ADMIN resolves correctly based on connector paths

## 🔄 Changed

- **Documentation Version Neutralization**
  - Removed hard-coded v0.20.0 references from user docs

- **Data Safe Status Documentation**
  - Added user-doc guidance for Data Safe `oradba_env.sh show/status` outputs

- **PDF User Guide Build**
  - Consolidated PDF generation into `scripts/build_pdf.sh` via `make docs`
  - PDF uses mkdocs navigation order and excludes API reference

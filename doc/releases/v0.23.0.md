# Release Notes v0.23.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Type:** Minor Release (Startup Performance + Cross-Platform Compatibility)

## Overview

Version 0.23.0 improves `oraenv.sh` startup behavior for login/profile usage,
adds a startup-optimized `--fast-silent` mode, and strengthens cross-platform
compatibility for macOS default Bash environments. It also prevents runtime
configuration files from being overwritten during installer/update workflows.

## ✨ Added

### Startup Profiling and Fast Silent Mode

- Added optional startup profiling with `ORADBA_PROFILE_STARTUP=true` in `oraenv.sh`
- Added per-phase timing output and effective startup flag reporting
- Added `--fast-silent` mode for startup-optimized silent initialization
- `--fast-silent` skips alias generation and SQLPATH setup during startup

## 🛠️ Fixed

### macOS Bash 3.2 Compatibility

- Replaced Bash 4+ case conversion expansions in startup-critical paths with
  portable `tr`-based conversion
- Updated startup helpers to avoid Bash 4-only patterns in interactive and
  silent flows
- Fixed SQLPATH assembly to use BSD-compatible `paste` invocation on macOS
- Added macOS Instant Client `.dylib` detection support

### Startup Performance and Discovery Safety

- Reduced startup overhead for non-database homes in `oraenv.sh`
- Added opt-in discovery/sync behavior for `oratab` → `oradba_homes.conf`
- Gated fallback sync paths to avoid writes when discovery is disabled
- Made alias generation honor `ORADBA_LOAD_ALIASES` in startup-optimized modes

### Installer Runtime File Protection

- Preserve/restore runtime-managed files during install/update copy:
  - `etc/oradba_homes.conf`
  - `etc/oratab`
  - `etc/sid.dummy.conf`
- Excluded runtime-generated files from installer build payload staging

## 🔄 Changed

### Startup Troubleshooting and User Guidance

- Updated user docs with startup troubleshooting and profiling workflow
- Added `--fast-silent` usage guidance in user documentation
- Documented trade-offs when skipping aliases and SQLPATH during fast startup

## 🚀 Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes.

### Recommended profile startup patterns

Use one of the following in login/profile scripts:

```bash
# Fastest startup
source oraenv.sh <NAME> --fast-silent

# Tuned silent mode
export ORADBA_LOAD_ALIASES_IN_SILENT=false
export ORADBA_CONFIGURE_SQLPATH_IN_SILENT=false
source oraenv.sh <NAME> --silent
```

If interactive aliases or SQLPATH-based SQL script lookup are required in a
session, source `oraenv.sh` again in normal mode.

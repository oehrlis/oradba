# Release Notes v0.22.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Type:** Patch Release (Integrity Verification)

## Overview

Version 0.22.1 fixes false-positive core integrity check results for
runtime-managed extension template cache files.

## 🛠️ Fixed

### Installer Integrity Verification Noise Reduction

- Core integrity verification now excludes runtime-managed files:
  - `templates/oradba_extension/.version`
  - `templates/oradba_extension/extension-template.tar.gz`
  - `.install_info`
- These files remain included in `.oradba.checksum` for installation metadata
  and distribution consistency.
- Prevents false `MODIFIED` reports after refreshing bundled extension template
  cache files.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_oradba_version.bats`.

## 🚀 Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes.

This is a verification behavior fix only; installation layout and extension
create workflow are unchanged.

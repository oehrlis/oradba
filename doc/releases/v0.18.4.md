# OraDBA v0.18.4 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Release Type:** Patch Release  
**Compatibility:** Backward compatible with v0.18.x

## Overview

This is a patch release that fixes a critical bug in extension installation
and adds a convenient Makefile target for managing GitHub release notes.

## What's New

### Fixed

#### Extension Installation Hidden Files Bug

Fixed a critical issue where hidden files were not being copied during
extension installation from tarball files.

**Impact:**

- Extensions installed from `.tar.gz` files were missing critical metadata
  files
- Files like `.extension`, `.checksumignore`, `.extension.checksum`, and
  `etc/.env.example` were not installed
- Extensions appeared installed but were missing version information and
  configuration

**Resolution:**

- Replaced `cp -R` with glob pattern to more reliable methods
- Now uses `rsync -a` for file copying (preserves all files including hidden
  ones)
- Falls back to `tar` pipe method if rsync is not available
- All files are now properly copied during installation

**Files Changed:**

- `src/bin/oradba_extension.sh` - Updated file copying logic

### Added

#### GitHub Release Notes Management

Added a new Makefile target to streamline updating GitHub releases with
release notes.

**Usage:**

```bash
make release-notes
```

**Features:**

- Automatically updates GitHub release with notes from
  `doc/releases/v<VERSION>.md`
- Validates release notes file existence before attempting update
- Checks for GitHub CLI (`gh`) availability with helpful error messages
- Uses current VERSION file dynamically

**Example:**
For version 0.18.4, the command executes:

```bash
gh release edit v0.18.4 --notes-file doc/releases/v0.18.4.md
```

**Files Changed:**

- `Makefile` - Added `release-notes` target

## Upgrade Notes

### From v0.18.3

This is a straightforward patch update with no breaking changes. Simply
update your installation:

```bash
# Using the installer
./oradba_install.sh --update

# Or manually
cd $ORADBA_BASE
git pull
git checkout v0.18.4
```

### Extension Re-installation Recommended

If you installed extensions from tarball files between v0.18.3 and v0.18.4,
you should re-install them to ensure all metadata files are present:

```bash
# Remove existing extension
oradba_extension.sh remove <extension_name>

# Re-add from tarball
oradba_extension.sh add /path/to/extension.tar.gz
```

Verify the extension has all files:

```bash
ls -la $ORADBA_LOCAL_BASE/<extension_name>/
# Should now see .extension, .checksumignore, etc.
```

## Testing

- ✅ 332 test cases executed successfully

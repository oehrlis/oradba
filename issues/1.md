### Title:
Add number of tunnels/connections to oraenv.sh and oradba_env.sh status for Data Safe. Update Data Safe plugin.

### Description:
Enhance the `oraenv.sh` and `oradba_env.sh` scripts to include the status of Oracle Data Safe connections, with the following changes:

1. **Add Tunnel/Connection Information**:
   - Integrate the number of tunnels and connections into the status section of `oraenv.sh` and `oradba_env.sh`.

2. **Update Data Safe Plugin**:
   - Extend the Data Safe plugin to retrieve and display tunnel/connection information.

3. **Command Example**:
Utilize the following command to gather the required connection/tunnel details:
```bash
$ ./oracle_cman_home/bin/cmctl show tunnels -c cust_cman
```
**Sample Output:**
```

Current instance cust_cman is already started
Connecting to (address_list=(address=(protocol=TCPS)(host=localhost)(port=1520)))
